/**
 * The tsp package, for Travelling Salesman Problem, is used to compute the shortest path
 * going through all pickup and delivery points, while respecting the following rule : each pickup point
 * must be visited before the corresponding delivery point.
 * 
 * It's largely inspired by the code provided by our teachers as part of the PLD AGILE (E. Egyed-Zsigmond, P.-E. Portier, C. Solnon)
 * 
 * As part of our application, we modified the classes Graph, CompleteGraph, SeqIter and create new TSP classes (TSP1, TSP2 and TSP3).
 * Each of theses TSPs classes implements one different heuristic in the bound method.
